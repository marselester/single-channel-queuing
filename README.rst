===============================================
The single-channel queuing system with refusals
===============================================

It receives requests by ``n`` time. ``n`` is a uniformly distributed random
number. Request processing time ``m`` is a random variable with an exponential
distribution. If channel is not free when request arrives, then request will
be leaving system unserved.
